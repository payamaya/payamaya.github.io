This repository contains the source for Paul Yashouh's personal portfolio website. It's a Jekyll-based static site designed for GitHub Pages and organized with layouts, includes, and data-driven templates.

## Project at a glance

- Purpose: Present projects, work experience, skills, and contact information.
- Live: https://payamaya.github.io/
- Static site generator: Jekyll (published via GitHub Pages)

## Technology stack

- Jekyll (via `github-pages` gem)
- Ruby & Bundler for local builds
- Markup: Markdown + Liquid templates
- Styling: CSS (assets under `assets/css/`)
- Small vanilla JavaScript in `assets/js/`

See `.github/copilot/Technology_Stack.md` for more details.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: Ruby (recommended 2.7+ or 3.x), Bundler, Git.

```bash
# Install dependencies
gem install bundler --no-document
bundle install

# Serve locally with live reload
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

# Open http://127.0.0.1:4000
```

Push to the `main` branch of this repository to publish to GitHub Pages (this repo is a user page: `payamaya.github.io`).

## Project structure (high level)

- `_config.yml` â€” site configuration
- `Gemfile` â€” Ruby dependencies
- `_layouts/`, `_includes/` â€” HTML templates and fragments
- `_data/` â€” YAML data (projects, experience, navigation)
- `assets/` â€” CSS, JS, images
- Markdown pages at the repo root (index.md, about.md, projects.md, contact.md)
- `_site/` â€” generated site output (build artifact)

See `.github/copilot/Project_Folder_Structure.md` for details and guidance.

## Key features

- Data-driven templates for projects and experience (`_data/*.yml`).
- Componentized CSS under `assets/css/` (base, components, layout, pages, themes).
- Simple, unobtrusive JS for site behavior (menu, toggles).

## Development workflow

- Branching: use feature branches (e.g., `feat/â€¦`, `fix/â€¦`) and open PRs into `main`.
- Local preview: `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`.
- CI: a basic GitHub Action runs `jekyll build` and `html-proofer` on PRs to `main`.

See `.github/copilot/Workflow_Analysis.md` for recommendations.

## Coding standards and examples

Coding conventions and small code exemplars live under:

- `.github/copilot/Coding_Standards.md` and `CODING_STANDARDS.md` (root)
- `.github/copilot/Code_Exemplars.md` â€” small snippets for front-matter, includes, CSS patterns, and JS

Follow semantic HTML, consistent front-matter, and small, focused CSS components.

## Testing and validation

This repository uses a validation-first approach rather than runtime unit tests. See `.github/copilot/Unit_Tests.md` for recommended checks.

- CI runs HTMLProofer to catch broken links and common HTML issues. Consider adding `stylelint` and `markdownlint` to CI for CSS and Markdown checks.

## Contributing

Please read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution steps and local development instructions.

Basic flow:

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-change`
2. Run and verify locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`
3. Commit with a clear message and open a PR into `main`.
