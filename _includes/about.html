    <h2>💡 My Story</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a passionate <strong>System Developer</strong> with a deep interest in clean architecture,
      SOLID principles, and modern design patterns. My journey in software development began with
      a curiosity to understand how things work behind the screen — and it quickly evolved into a
      mission to build solutions that are <em>beautiful, efficient, and scalable</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, I’ve explored a range of technologies — from <strong>Java</strong> and
      <strong>C# .NET</strong> to <strong>React + TypeScript</strong> — always focusing on writing
      modular, testable, and maintainable code.
